sheng.git
=========

Code for a work in progress, for sheng[1] and computer running SuperCollider[2].

Note: This github repository is being created without any actual code :)  I need to prepare a software environment for rehearsal, containing a clone from which the performer can pull.

This code does not compile to a static executable! It includes a lot of loose experimentation that is probably not useful to anyone except the author. The project will not be extensively documented.

Code is in SuperCollider. SC users are welcome to read the code to glean possibly useful tricks.
